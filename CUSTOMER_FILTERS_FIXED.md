# Customer Filters Fix Documentation

## Issue
The filters in the customer section were not working. When selecting filter values for status or customer type, the page would not reload with the filtered data.

## Root Cause
1. Frontend was only applying filters client-side on already fetched data
2. Backend API endpoint didn't support filter parameters
3. Filters were not triggering new API calls when values changed

## Solution Implemented

### Frontend Changes (frontend/src/pages/Customers.js)

1. **Added server-side filtering**:
   - Modified `fetchCustomers` to include all filter parameters in API request
   - Removed client-side filtering logic since filtering is now done server-side
   - Added debounced search to avoid too many API calls while typing

2. **Improved filter state management**:
   - Added `debouncedSearch` state for search input debouncing (500ms delay)
   - Modified useEffect to trigger API calls when filters change
   - Reset pagination when filters change (except for debounced search)

3. **Key changes**:
   ```javascript
   // Added debounce for search
   const [debouncedSearch, setDebouncedSearch] = useState('');
   
   // Trigger API call when filters change
   useEffect(() => {
     fetchCustomers();
   }, [pagination.limit, pagination.offset, filters.status, filters.customer_type, debouncedSearch]);
   
   // Include all filters in API request
   if (debouncedSearch) params.search = debouncedSearch;
   if (filters.status) params.status = filters.status;
   if (filters.customer_type) params.customer_type = filters.customer_type;
   ```

### Backend Changes

1. **Customer Repository** (backend/app/infrastucture/database/repositories/customer_repository.py):
   - Added `get_with_filters` method that supports:
     - Status filter (active, pending, rejected, inactive)
     - Customer type filter (cash, credit)
     - Search filter (searches in name, email, phone_number)
     - Returns both filtered results and total count

2. **Customer Service** (backend/app/services/customers/customer_service.py):
   - Added `get_customers_with_filters` method
   - Loads addresses for each filtered customer
   - Returns tuple of (customers, total_count)

3. **API Endpoint** (backend/app/presentation/api/customers/customer.py):
   - Updated GET /customers endpoint to accept filter parameters:
     - `status`: Filter by customer status
     - `customer_type`: Filter by customer type
     - `search`: Search in name, email, or phone
   - Now returns accurate total count for pagination

## Filter Options

### Status Filter
- **active**: Active customers
- **pending**: Pending approval
- **rejected**: Rejected customers  
- **inactive**: Inactive customers

### Customer Type Filter
- **cash**: Cash customers
- **credit**: Credit customers

### Search Filter
- Searches across customer name, email, and phone number
- Case-insensitive search
- Partial matching supported

## Testing
The filters now work correctly:
1. Selecting a status filter immediately reloads the page with only customers of that status
2. Selecting a customer type filter shows only cash or credit customers
3. Search filter has a 500ms debounce to avoid excessive API calls
4. Filters can be combined (e.g., show only active cash customers)
5. Pagination resets when filters change to show results from the first page
6. Total count updates correctly based on filtered results
